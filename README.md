# S55_Divyam_Capstone_Dabbawala

## Idea Brief :
**Dabbawala** is a pioneering flatform inspired by the efficient delivery systems of dabbawalas, currently operating within Maharashtra. The central idea revolves around  offering individuals the convenience of enjoying wholesome home-cooked meals delivered right to their doorstep.The initiative will  not only cater to the needs of those craving nutritious home cooked meals  but also act as a lifeline to individuals away from home, yearning for the taste of a familiar meal. Through Dabbawala I aspire to redefine food delivery by prioritizing quality, health and the warmth of home-cooked goodness on a Pan-India scale.
